The ABS publishes the CPI broken down into 11 main groups and 87 expenditure classes.
This provides granular data that can be used to set realistic default weights for your application's "average" household.

The 11 main groups of the CPI are the building blocks of the index and represent
the actual categories of goods and services Australians spend money on.
The analytical series, on the other hand, are constructed to provide different perspectives on inflation by removing specific components.

Here are the 11 main groups that are used to build the CPI basket:

- Food and non-alcoholic beverages
- Alcohol and tobacco
- Clothing and footwear
- Housing
- Furnishings, household equipment and services
- Health
- Transport
- Communication
- Recreation and culture
- Education
- Insurance and financial services
